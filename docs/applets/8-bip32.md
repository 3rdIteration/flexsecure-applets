## Compiling the Applet Yourself

Setup your environment as described in *JavaCard Development Setup* .

Use git to clone the sources recursively, and change into the directory. To compile, run `./gradlew convertJavacard`.

## Installing the Applet

The cabinet file contains three distinct applets, of which the NDEF one is not needed. The other two (core and cash) need to be installed.

Use GlobalPlatformPro (GPP) from https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releases to install the applets:

```
gp -load keycard.cap

gp -package A0000008040001 -applet A000000804000101 -create A00000080400010101

gp -package A0000008040001 -applet A000000804000103 -create A00000080400010301
```

Listing the applets using `gp --list` should print something like this:

```
APP: A00000080400010101 (SELECTABLE)
     Parent:  A000000151000000
     From:    A0000008040001

     Privs:
